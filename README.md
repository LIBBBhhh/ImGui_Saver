# ImGui_Saver
a utility that saves imgui settings in an ini file without fiddling with files and other things



### Usage:

the operating documentation is located in saver.h



### UPD: 



this will be supported for as long as my imagination allows


and yes, since the first version will turn out to be small and may not work on Zigisk modules with imgui, then modify it for yourself, make mods, I will be very happy about this because someone needs my project hotl
